array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. 
Save it to a variable called `topics`.*/
/*2. Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.
   * Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.*/

/*3. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated 
gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.*/

/*4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should 
animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.*/
